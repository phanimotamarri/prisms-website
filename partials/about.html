            <p class="tab-content-details">
                Combining the efforts of computational and experimental researchers, the goal of this Center is
                development of an integrated suite of validated computational tools that are designed to accelerate the
                development of new structural metals.</p>

                Our Center is formally known as the DOE Software Innovation Center for Integrated Multi-Scale Modeling
                of Structural Metals. We call it PRISMS for short which stands for PRedictive Integrated Structural
                Materials Science. Our ambitious goal is for our PRISMS tools to be the extensible scientific core of
                the Integrated Computational Materials Engineering.
