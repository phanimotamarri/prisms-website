        The influence of grain size, grain size distribution and grain orientations have a well-documented influence on
        the mechanical properties of metal alloys. Thus developing and demonstrating a capability for predicting these
        characteristics is an important PRISMS capability. This use case also represents an opportunity to demonstrate
        the capabilities of a new computational methodology, Phase Field Crystal for predicting grain boundary energies.

        Using the phase-field crystal method, grain boundary energy will be calculated as a function of the orientations
        of two grains. This data will be used to parameterize a phase-field model for grain growth that allows for
        anisotropic grain boundary energy. To determine the mobility of grain boundaries undeformed polycrystalline
        sample are annealed and the grain size as a function of time measured and from the growth kinetics the mobility
        can be estimated. Recrystallization rates of deformed microstructures are also determined experimentally for
        parameterization of phase field models for recrystallization.
